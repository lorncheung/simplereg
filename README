=== SIMPLE REGISTRATION === 

An example of a three-step signup process using authlogic and standard rails practices
 
1. User submits email address, activation email is sent out.
2. User clicks link in activation email, which takes them to a form
where they enter their first name, last name, and password. When
submitting that, they're shown another form.
3. This form asks for some extra details: birth date, location, and job history.  They 
can add a new job up to 7.
4. User is logged in and can return to edit their full profile anytime.


== Requirements ==  

1. authlogic gem
2. mysql & mysql gem (create simple_test and simple_development databases) 

Setup:
1. sudo gem install authlogic
2. install mysql; create database simple_test; create database simple_development
3. set environment variables values for GMAIL_DOMAIN, GMAIL_USER, GMAIL_PASS 
4. script/server -d 
 

== NOTES ==
I couldn't get gmail to block emails sent from my macbook so I had to resort to proxying through gmail.  
Make sure your gmail settings are set before running the app.
